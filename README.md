To execute tasks use the following syntax:

`nx [target] [project] [...options]`

You can also run multiple targets: `nx run-many -t [target1] [target2]`

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

`nx run-many -t [target1] [target2] -p [proj1] [proj2]`

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/core-features/run-tasks).

### Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.
